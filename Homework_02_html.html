        <h1>Mathematical formulas</h1>
    </center>
    <p>
        A linear equation is any equation that can be written in the form
    </p>
    <p class="formula-center">
        <span  class="fantasy">ax+b=0</span>
    </p>
    <p>
        where <span class="letter">a</span> and b are real numbers and x is a variable.This form is sometimes called the standart form of in a
        linear
        equation.Note that most linear equations will not start of in this form.Also the variable may or may not be an x
        so don`t get too locked into always seeing an x there.
    </p>
    <h2>Linear Equations</h2>
    <p>The stardant form of a quadratic equation looks like this:</p>
    <p class="fantasy">ax<sup>2</sup>+bx+c=0</p>
    <p>
        where a,b,c are known values and x is the variable or unknown (we dont known it yet.Also,a can`t be 0.
    </p>
    <h3>The area of a circle (A)</h3>
    <p>
        p(Pi)times the radius (r) squared:
    </p>
    <p class="fantasy">
       A=p*r<sup>2</sup>
    </p>
    <p>
        or when you known the Diametr (D):</p>
    <p class="fantasy">
        A=(p/4)*D<sup>2</sup>
    </p>
    <p>or when you known the circumference</p>
    <p class="fantasy">
        <center>A= C<sup>2</sup>/4*p</center>
    </p>
    <h4>Intersection</h4>
    <p>
        The intersection of two sets A and B, denoted by A B, is the setof all objects that are members of both the sets
        A and B.In symbols,</p>
    <p class="fantasy">
        <center>A and B={x:xє A and xє B}</center>
    </p>
    <p>That is x is an element of the intersection A and B if and only if x is both an element of A and an element of B
    </p>
